<h5>Proposal 1</h5><hr>


<h4>[AGREED]</h4>

<p>We've just changed the struct syntax to use () instead of {}. We
independently observed that, now that structs no longer look like JSON
objects, the syntax for naming fields looks rather strange:</p>

        <p>(1, 2, c: 3)</p>

<p>You said you preferred:</p>

        <p>(1, 2, c=3)</p>

<p>I also prefer that, but I think we can do better. Named fields are already
forbidden in L-values and function calls. I propose we forbid names in
struct literals too.</p>

<p>It remains useful to be able to name the fields of structs. It is obviously
useful both as and for documentation. In addition, it supports the ".field"
syntax.</p>

<p>If we accept this proposal, the only remaining way to name the fields of
structs will be when defining struct types:</p>

       <p> struct foo{int, int, c: int}</p>

<p>The fields of struct values can then be named by casting the struct to a
type with named fields:</p>

        <p>(1, 2, 3): foo</p>

<p>The cost of this simplification is that you cannot name a field without
giving it an explicit type too.</p>

<h2> Proposal 1a </h2>


<p>[AGREED]</p>

<p>I propose we also allow call syntax for struct types:</p>

        <p>foo(1, 2, 3)</p>

<h1>Proposal 2</h1>


<p>[AGREED]</p>

<p>The syntax for defining struct types is very similar to that for defining
function types:</p>

        <p>struct {int, const int, c: int}</p>
        <p>function (int, const int, c: int): void</p>

<p>The syntax for constructing struct values is very similar to that for
calling functions:</p>

        <p>(1, 2, 3)</p>
        <p>foo(1, 2, 3)</p>

<p>The one glaring irregularity is that struct types use curly brackets. I
propose we use round brackets for struct types too.</p>

<p>The cost of this simplification is similarity to C syntax.</p>

<h1> Proposal 3a and 3b </h1>


<p>We plan to make it optional to declare the constnesses of the fields of
structs:</p>

        <p>struct foo{var int, const int, c: int}</p>

<p>It is already optional to declare the constnesses of the parameters of
function types:</p>

        <p>function foo(var int, const int, c: int): void</p>

<p>In both cases, we're not quite sure what to do with the constnesses, despite
having discussed it repeatedly. The current design is:</p>

<ul> <li> Constnesses are not stored in struct types. The validator for struct
types has not been written.</li>

 <li> At the moment, the constness of a field of a struct value is equal to the
constness of the struct itself. We discussed how this might be combined with
the constness from the field declaration in the struct's type. The current
plan is that the field is const if either is const.</li>
<li>Constnesses are not stored in function types. They are erased in the
flattener. In other words, they have the status of comments.</li>

<li>Constnesses are applied to parameters in function definitions. However,
they only affect local variables, and you have observed that constnesses are
almost useless when the entire lifetime of a variable is within one
compilation unit.</li> </ul>

<p>I propose:</p>
<ul>
 <li>that we forbid "const" and "var" in (3a) struct types [AGREED], (3b)
function types [AGREED] and (3c) function definitions [AGREED], (and that
they remain forbidden in struct values).</li>

 <li>that the constness of a field of a struct is always the same as the
constness of the struct.</li>

 <li> that the constness of a function parameter is always some default.
Currently the default we have agreed is "var", though I weakly prefer
"const". [2016-02-17: We later changed it to "const".]</li></ul>

<p>The cost of simplification 3a is that to mix const and var values in the
same data structure you have to use a level of indirection. For example:</p>

        <p>struct inet_addr {</p>
         <p> domain_name: str,</p>
          <p>ip_addr_cache: ref var struct {byte, byte, byte, byte},</p>
       <p> }</p>

<p>The cost of simplification 3c that if you want to give a parameter an
explicit constness, you have instead to declare a local that shadows it. For
example:</p>

       <p> function add_up(accumulator: int, ...): int {</p>
          <p>var accumulator = accumulator</p>
          <p>accumulator += ...</p>
       <p> }</p>
