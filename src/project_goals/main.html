<li>Goal: combine the advantages of C, Python and Java.</li>

<li> C is fast and powerful, but too low-level.</li>

<li> Java is fast and high-level, but you're stuck in a "walled garden”.</li>

<li> Python is powerful and high-level, but will never be fast.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a given project, it is often necessary to choose between these languages (or similar). Choice has to be made early, and can have a big effect on the success of the project. For example:</p>

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>  Choose C and you will always find complex things difficult.</li>

<li> Choose Python and you will always have limited performance.</li>

<li> Choose Java and you will always be in a "walled garden”.</li></ul>

<p>There is room for a language between these.</p>

<h1 class="lead">Sub-goals</h1>
<hr>

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li> Simplify the tool chain. Who needs a "compiler" tool? Only the computer should care.</li>

<li>  Provide proper structs. Especially, provide arrays of structs, and functions to/from structs.</li>

<li>  Provide proper (tagged) unions. If Java needed enumerations (it did), it also needs unions.</li>

<li>  Unify the language with its own preprocessor language. If they're different, at least one must be wrong.</li>

<li> Don't make any basic mistakes (see later).</li>
</ul>
