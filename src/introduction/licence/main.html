Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)
------------------------------------

"This implementation" means the copyrightable work that implements the Welly
language distributed by the Welly authors.

The Welly authors and contributors hereby grant to you a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
transfer, and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this
implementation of Welly, where such license applies only to those patent
claims, both currently owned by the Welly authors and contributors and
acquired in the future, licensable by the Welly authors and contributors that
are necessarily infringed by this implementation of Welly. This grant does not
include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of this implementation. If you or your agent or exclusive
licensee institute or order or agree to the institution of patent litigation
or any other patent enforcement activity against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of this
implementation of Welly or any code incorporated within any of this
implementation of Welly constitute direct or contributory patent infringement,
or inducement of patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you
under this License for this implementation of Welly shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.
