<h1>Contact Us</h1>

<p class="lead">We have a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/wellylang">mailing list</a> which
you can use to contact us in the first instance. The list is moderated
and the archive is public. Conversations started there can move somewhere else
if necessary to avoid bothering other subscribers.</p>

<p>This website (unlike the Welly language) has a public
<a href="https://github.com/wellylang/wellylang.org">version control
repository</a>, including an issue tracker, which could be useful to anybody
who wants to improve it.</p>
