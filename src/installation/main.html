  <hr>
  <p class="lead">Currently Welly is mocked up inside Python but in near future there are different plans for it to be running independently </p> 
 <ul>
 	<a href="https://www.python.org/"><li> First download python 2.7</li></a>
 	<a href="#"><li>Download Welly</li></a>
 	<li>We recommend you use <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5087790"> "rlwrap" </a>utility </li>
 	</ul>
 	<p> After downloading Welly open your terminal and change directory to wherever you downloaded Welly. </p>
 	<p> For example:
 	"cd welly/src" Run "repl.sh" Start writing in Welly!
 	To run unit tests Run py.test </p>
