<h1>Data types</h1>

<p>This section lists all Welly's data types. For each one, it specifies:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the Welly source code syntax for the type,
 <li>the Welly value that represents the type,
 <li>the meaning of the type, and
 <li>the way values of the type are represented in memory.
</ul>

<p>There is a <a href="design/data_model.html">design document</a> explaining
why we've chosen these particular types.</p>

$include{version-warning.html}


<h2>Every value has...</h2>

<p>Before listing the available types, we can say a few things that apply to
all values.</p>

<ul>
 <li>All values are represented by a contiguous string of bytes in memory,
 possibly including pointers to other values.</li>

 <li>Assignment, copying, referencing, dereferencing, and function call and
 return are all defined as operations on the string of bytes, and cannot be
 overridden.</li>

 <li>All values have properties needed to allow them to be included as fields
 of structs.</li>

 <li>All values obey disciplines needed to support garbage collection.</li>

 <li>All values can be "const" (immutable) or "var" (mutable).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Strings of bytes</h3>

<p>A "value" is something that can be stored in a variable. Welly values are
(conceptually) always stored in memory as a contiguous string of bytes. To be
more specific, values will always be stored somewhere inside a block of memory
allocated in the heap (there is no stack allocation in Welly). There is a wide
variety of different kinds of value, but they all satisfy this universal
property.</p>

<p>In practice, values will sometimes be held in virtual machine registers,
which may in turn be held in x86 registers. However, that is an optimisation
which is invisible to programmers. Similarly, where the specification
says that Welly will copy a value, the optimiser might decide not to bother,
and if it can prove that no harm will come of sharing the original. For
simplicity, this specification describes the unoptimised version.</p>

<p>Some values require other data to be stored elsewhere in memory. For
example, an array value is just a short header, including a pointer to another
heap block containing the array elements. The other heap block is not
considered to be part of the value, because it is not part of the contiguous
string of bytes. This distinction matters when a value is copied.</p>


<h3>Universal operations</h3>

<p>Every value supports a few universal operations, which are defined in terms
of the string of bytes that represents the value:</p>

<ul>
 <li>When you write the assignment statement <code>a = b</code>, it always
 means the same thing: find the string of bytes that represents
 <code>b</code>, and the range of memory addresses that represents
 <code>a</code>, and copy the former into the latter. No exception is made
 for any type of value.</li>

 <li>When you write the expression <code>new a</code> it always means the same
 thing: find the string of bytes representing <code>a</code>, allocate a new
 mutable heap block that is just big enough, copy the bytes into it, and
 return a reference to it. No exception is made for any type of value.</li>

 <li>When you write the expression <code>&amp;a</code> it always means the
 same thing: find the range of memory addresses that represents
 <code>a</code>, and return a reference to them. No exception is made for any
 type of value.</li>

 <li>When you write the struct expression <code>(a, b)</code> it always means
 the same thing: make a string of bytes containing the bytes that represent
 <code>a</code> and those that represent <code>b</code>. The layout is chosen
 in a defined way, depending on the sizes and alignments of <code>a</code> and
 <code>b</code>.</li>

 <li>When you pass a value to a function, or return a value from a function,
 it is always done by allocating a fresh immutable heap block and copying the
 bytes of the value into it. This means that the value is passed by value. To
 pass a value by reference, you have to take its address and pass that
 instead. You can only pass one value; to pass multiple values you have to
 pass a struct instead.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Size and alignment</h3>

<p>Every value has a size, being the number of bytes it occupies. The size is
not stored in memory (in general) but is instead calculated at compile time.
</p>

<p>Every value also has an alignment, which can be 0, 1, 2, 4 or 8.
The address at which a value is stored in memory must be a multiple of its
alignment. Like the size, the alignment of a value is calculated at compile
time.</p>

<p>Values with alignment zero must all be stored at address zero. This
alignment is only used for values of zero length, such as the empty struct, of
type <code>void</code>. It is used for all such values. It is not possible to
read or write bytes from/to such values, so it does not really matter what
their address is; giving them an alignment of zero is just a way of saying
"don't care".</p>

<p>On most processors, words of size <em>n</em> can (efficiently) only be read
from or written to addresses that are multiples of <em>n</em>. For example, if
you want to copy a large value eight bytes at a time, it has to be
eight-byte-aligned. To allow itself to copy values in a reasonable number of
operations, Welly therefore imposes a minimum alignment on values, equal to a
quarter of their size, or eight, whichever is smaller. For example, a string
of nineteen bytes will have an alignment of eight, and can therefore be copied
as two words of eight bytes, one word of two bytes, and one more byte.</p>

<p>In summary, the allowed combinations of size and alignment are as
follows:</p>

$include{sizes.html}

<p>Heap blocks in Welly always have addresses that are a multiple of eight.
Therefore, any value can be stored at the start of a heap block without any
further checks. It is to ensure this property that Welly does not support
alignments larger than eight.</p>


<h3>Pointers</h3>

<p>Every value has the ability to enumerate the pointers inside it. It is
important that the garbage collector is aware of all pointers inside values,
as this is needed to define which heap blocks are reachable and which are
garbage. It is also needed to allow the garbage collector to update pointers
when it moves heap blocks around in memory.</p>

<p>Like the size and alignment of a value, the locations of the pointers
within a value are not stored in memory as part of the value. Instead, they
are calculated at compile time, depending only on the value's type. At run
time, the program can manipulate the value efficiently, without having to
manipulate type information as well.</p>

<p>Having said that, some metadata is stored in a separate area of memory
whenever a heap block is allocated. The metadata is not accessible from within
Welly, but is only accessed during garbage collection. The metadata is
designed to be general enough to support other languages besides Welly, and
uses a format that is simpler than Welly's types.</p>

<p>Pointers are eight bytes long. Any value that contains a pointer must have
an alignment of eight.</p>

<p>Welly supposes that every non-zero 64-bit value can in principle be a
pointer. Pointers always point inside allocated heap blocks, but not always to
the start of those blocks, so pointers are not always multiples of 8. Welly
does not "steal" any of the bits of a pointer for purposes other than storing
the address of the pointee.</p>


<h3>Constness</h3>

<p>Every value is either <code>const</code> or <code>var</code>. Values that
are <code>const</code> cannot be modified by anyone, and can be relied upon
not to change over time. Values that are <code>var</code> can be modified by
anyone, and the changes will be seen by everyone. Both contnesses are useful.
</p>

<p>The constness of a value depends on where a value is stored. Constness is
orthogonal to type; i.e. either constness can be combined with any type. The
constness is determined when the value is first created, and cannot be changed
without making a copy of the value.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>const</code> and <code>var</code> values, one
sometimes encounters values of unknown constness. There is no third constness
really; every such value is either <code>const</code> or <code>var</code>.
Saying that the constness of a value is unknown simply means that your code
must work in both cases. Values of unknown constness cannot safely be
modified, but nor can they be trusted not to change their value.</p>


<h2>Types of value</h2>

<p>Every storage location and every value in Welly has a type. A value can be
stored in a location if and only if their types are compatible.</p>

<p>The type of a value tells you how it is represented in memory. The
representation of a value is chosen to be compact, while still being able to
distinguish it from other values of the same type.</p>

<p>We say that a type <code>t</code> is a subtype of a type <code>u</code>
if all values that can be stored in a location of type <code>t</code> can also
be stored in a location of type <code>u</code>. Subtyping arises in Welly in
several ways. Read more about <a href="reference/subtypes.html">subtypes</a>.
</p>

<p>Unlike in many programming languages, types are themselves first-class
values, which can be stored in variables and passed to functions. Therefore,
types have a type. The type of types is called <code>type</code>, and it has the
following definition:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>union constness {
    BASE
    CONST
    VAR
}

union type {
    PRIMITIVE(uint8, uint8)
    REF(constness, type)
    ARRAY0
    ARRAY(constness, type)
    STRUCT(array const struct {name: str, type: type})
    UNION(array const struct {name: str, type: array const type})
    FUNCTION(array const type, type)
    DYNAMIC
    MACRO
    WITH(type, module)
    // TODO...
} with { ... }</code>
</pre>

<p>This means that every type is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A primitive type.</li>
 <li>One of three kinds of <code>ref</code> or <code>array</code> type.</li>
 <li>The type of empty arrays (written <code>array0</code> in source code).</li>
 <li>A <code>fn</code> type.</li>
 <li>A <code>struct</code> type.</li>
 <li>A <code>union</code> type.</li>
 <li>One of the special types <code>dynamic</code> and <code>macro</code>.</li>
 <li>A <code>with</code> type.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Primitive</h3>

<p><em>[Aspirational - the current implementation is simpler.]</em></p>

<p>The primitive types defined in Welly's standard library are:</p>

$include{primitive.html}

<p>There is no separate 64-bit <code>uint</code> type, because 64-bit integers
are never implicitly sign-extended. Read more about
<a href="design/signedness.html">signedness</a>.</p>

<p>These types will all be represented as instances of
<code>PRIMITIVE(size, alignment)</code>. The differences between them will be
represented by wrapping the type in a <code>with</code> type. This arrangement
allows libraries written by third parties to define new primitive types.</p>


<h3>References</h3>

<p>It is possible to take the address of any existing Welly value, without
copying it into a heap block all of its own. Such an address is called a
"reference". The Welly syntax for taking the address of a value <code>x</code>
is <code>&amp;x</code>. The Welly syntax for the type of a reference to type
<code>t</code> is <code>ref t</code>, <code>ref const t</code> or
<code>ref var t</code>.</p>

<p>The difference between the three kinds of reference is as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>ref</code> neither guarantees that the value won't change, nor
 allows the value to be modified.</li>
 <li><code>ref const</code> guarantees that the value pointed to won't
 change.</li>
 <li><code>ref var</code> allows the value to  be modified.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ref t</code> offers the weakest guarantee. It is useful because it
is a supertype of the other two; a function that accepts <code>ref t</code>
can accept any reference to type <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>References occupy a single word: a pointer to the referee. They have a size
of 8 and an alignment of 8. References can refer to locations in the middle of
a heap block.</p>

<p>Note the distinction between references and pointers. References are
first-class values that are represented as pointers. However, pointers are a
low-level concept that is also used for other purposes, and pointers are not
always first-class values.</p>


<h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>An array block is a heap block that contains many values of the same type,
packed together as closely as possible. The values are called the "elements"
of the array. The size of an array block is the size of each value plus
padding, times the number of elements. The number of elements is not stored
in the array block; anyone with a reference into the array block is expected
to know how many elements they can access there. Array blocks are not
first-class values in Welly; you can't stored them in variables, or pass
them to functions.</p>

<p>An array value is a pointer into an array block (not necessarily to the first
element) along with the number of elements that may be accessed via the
pointer. An array value is a first-class value.</p>

<p>The Welly syntax for an array literal is <code>[a, b, c]</code>, where
<code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are values of the same type
(there can be any number of values, from 0 upwards). The "array" module in
the standard library provides other ways of constructing array values.</p>

<p>The Welly syntax for the type of an array with element type <code>t</code>
is <code>array t</code>, <code>array const t</code> or
<code>array var t</code> (see the section "References" above for an
explanation of what these mean).</p>

<p>Arrays have a size of 16 and an alignment of 8.</p>


<h3>Strings</h3>

<p><em>[Aspirational - the current version treats strings as a special case.]
</em></p>

<p>Strings in Welly are represented as immutable arrays of bytes, i.e. strings
are assignment-compatible with <code>array const byte</code>. The characters
of the string are packed into the array using the UTF-8 encoding. The type of
strings is called <code>str</code>.</p>


<h3>Structs</h3>

<p>Values can be concatenated into a <code>struct</code>. The Welly syntax for
writing the concatenation of values <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and
<code>c</code> is <code>(a, b, c)</code>. The Welly syntax for writing the
type of the struct is <code>struct (t, u, v)</code>, in which <code>t</code>,
<code>u</code> and <code>v</code> are the types of <code>a</code>,
<code>b</code> and <code>c</code> respectively.</p>

<p>The constituent values of a struct are called its "fields". The size and
alignment of a struct is calculated from the size and alignment of its
fields. The offset of each field within a struct (by which I mean the
difference between the address of the field and the address of the struct) is
similarly calculated.</p>

<p>Structs are built from left to right. Each value is placed at the smallest
offset that is consistent with its alignment and that does not cause it to
overlap with any previous value. Note that it is possible for later fields to
have a smaller offset than earlier fields, if they have a smaller alignment.
When the struct is complete, the gaps are filled with padding bytes. The size
of the struct is the offset of the first unused byte, and the alignment is the
largest alignment of any member.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Example 1: <code>struct (a: byte, b: int, c: byte)</code></dt>
 <dd><code>a</code> has offset 0; <code>b</code> has offset 8; <code>c</code>
 has offset 1. There are six bytes of padding at offset 2. The size of the
 struct is 16 and its alignment is 8.</dd>

 <dt>Example 2: <code>struct (struct (a: byte, b: int), c: byte)</code></dt>
 <dd><code>a</code> has offset 0; <code>b</code> has offset 8; <code>c</code>
 has offset 16. There are seven bytes of padding at offset 1. The size of the
 struct is 17 and its alignment is 8. <code>c</code> cannot be placed at offset
 1 because it would overlap with the padding of the inner struct.</dd>

 <dt>Example 3: <code>struct (struct (a: int, b: byte), c: byte)</code></dt>
 <dd> <code>a</code> has offset 0; <code>b</code> has offset 8; <code>c</code>
 has offset 9. There is no padding. The size of the struct is 10 and its
 alignment is 8.</dd>

 <dt>Example 4: <code>struct (a: byte, struct (b: int, c: byte))</code></dt>
 <dd><code>a</code> has offset 0; <code>b</code> has offset 8; <code>c</code>
 has offset 16. There are seven bytes of padding at offset 1. The size of the
 struct is 17 and its alignment is 8. The inner struct cannot be placed at
 offset 1 because it has an alignment of 8.</dd>

 <dt>Example 5: <code>struct (a: byte, struct (b: byte, c: int))</code></dt>
 <dd><code>a</code> has offset 0; <code>b</code> has offset 8; <code>c</code>
 has offset 16. There are seven bytes of padding at offset 1, and another seven
 bytes of padding at offset 9, i.e. at offset 1 of the inner struct. The size
 of the struct is 24 and its alignment is 8. The inner struct cannot be placed
 at offset 1 because it has an alignment of 8.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Void</h3>

<p><em>[Implemented, but likely to change.]</em></p>

<p>The type <code>void</code> is a synonym for <code>struct ()</code>. It has
only one value: <code>()</code>. Therefore, a function that returns
<code>void</code> does not return any information.</p>


<h3>Unions</h3>

<p>Unions are Welly's algebraic types. Unions are useful when you want a
storage location that is able to hold more than one type of value. Each type
of value that the location can hold is called a "case". The cases are
named.</p>

<p>Case names are written in capital letters; they are lexically distinguished
from identifiers, which must always contain a lower-case letter.</p>

<p>A good example of an algebraic type is the type of a binary tree with
<code>ring</code>s on its branches and <code>bell</code>s on its leaves
(<code>ring</code> and <code>bell</code> being previously defined types).
This type has two cases:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A <code>LEAF</code> contains a <code>bell</code>.</li>
 <li>A <code>BRANCH</code> contains a <code>tree</code>, a <code>ring</code>
 and another <code>tree</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Welly syntax for this type is:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>union tree {
    LEAF(bell)
    BRANCH(tree, ring, tree)
}</code>
</pre>

<p>The Welly syntax for constructing a <code>LEAF</code> is
<code>LEAF(x)</code> where <code>x</code> is a <code>bell</code>.
<code>x</code> is called the "payload" of the union value. (In the case where
the payload is empty, the brackets can be omitted, i.e. <code>NONE()</code>
can be written <code>NONE</code>).</p>

<p>A union type with more cases than this one is a supertype of it (assuming
the payloads are compatible). A union type with fewer cases is a subtype. Read
more about <a href="reference/subtypes.html">subtypes</a>.</p>

<p>A union value always occupies 16 bytes, and always has an alignment of 8.
The case name is stored at offset 0, represented as a 64-bit hash. The payload
value is stored in a separate heap block. A pointer to it is stored at offset
8.</p>

<p>Note that the word at offset 0 is never a pointer, and the word at offset 8
is always a pointer. That's all the garbage collector needs to know, because
the payload is a separate heap block with its own metadata.</p>

<p>Note another restriction on the representation of union values: when a
value is cast from a subtype to a supertype, its representation must not
change. Thus, it is not possible for any union value to occupy less than 16
bytes.</p>


<h3>Never</h3>

<p>[Implemented, but likely to change.]</p>

<p>The type <code>never</code> is a synonym for <code>union {}</code>. It does
not have any values. Therefore, a function that returns <code>never</code>
cannot return (except by throwing an exception).</p>


<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Functions are first-class values in Welly. The Welly syntax for a function
literal is <code>fn name(a:t, b:u, c:v): w { ... }</code> where
<code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are the parameter names,
<code>t</code>, <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> are their types, and
<code>w</code> is the return type (which can often be omitted). The syntax for
the type of that function is <code>fn(t, u, v): w</code>.</p>

<p>Function values have a size of 16 and an alignment of 8. A pointer to the
code for the function is stored at offset 0. The non-static values captured
when the function was defined are packed into a struct and stored in a
separate heap block. A pointer to the capture struct is stored at offset 8.</p>

<p>[TODO: Cross-reference a page about the calling convention, and check that
it is up to date. Make sure it defines how to throw an exception.]</p>


<h3>Dynamic</h3>

<p>Dynamic values are useful when you want to store a value whose type is not
a compile-time-known constant. The Welly syntax for wrapping up a value
<code>x</code> as a dynamic value is <code>dynamic(x)</code>. If
<code>y</code> is a dynamic value, then <code>y.type</code> is the type of
the value it contains. If in addition <code>y</code> is known at compile time,
then <code>y.value</code> is the value it contains.</p>

<p>Dynamic values have a size of 40 and an alignment of 8. The constness of
the value is stored at offset 0. The type of the value is stored at offset 16.
The value itself is stored in a separate heap block, and a pointer to it is
stored at offset 32.</p>

<p>It is quite wasteful to use 16 bytes for the constness, which only has
three possible values. We are likely to optimise the representation at some
point.</p>


<h3>Macros</h3>

<p><em>[Aspirational and unfinished.]</em></p>

<p>Macros are first-class values. The representation of macros is
implementation-defined. The type of macros is called <code>macro</code>.</p>


<h3>Modules</h3>

<p><em>[Implemented, but likely to change.]</em></p>

<p>Modules are first-class values. The representation of modules is
implementation-defined, but they typically use a representation that can be
defined and manipulated by Welly source code, i.e. something described
elsewhere in this document. The type of modules is called <code>module</code>,
and it is an opaque type.</p>


<h3><code>with</code> types</h3>

<p><em>[Principle agreed, mechanism not. See [TODO] "doc/extensions/compact.txt"
for an alternative design.]</em></p>

<p>It is possible to define a type that is based on another type, and
assignment compatible with it, but with different meanings for its operators.
The Welly syntax for defining a type <code>u</code> based on <code>t</code>
is:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>const u = t with(wrap) { ... }</code>
</pre>

<p>The braces have the same syntax as the body of a module, and typically
contain macros defining the various operators, and any other API that values
of type <code>u</code> support. The way in which this is done is described in
"reference/operators.html".</p>

<p>Values of type <code>u</code> have the same representation as values of
type <code>t</code>, and are inter-assignable with them. In particular, you
can use the cast operator <code>:</code> to convert a value between the two
types, in either direction.</p>

<p>Values of type <code>u</code> have exactly the same size and alignment as
values of type <code>t</code>.</p>
