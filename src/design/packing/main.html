<h3>Packing and unpacking</h3>

<p><em>[Aspirational]</em></p>

<p>When representing values as a string of bytes, some
types employ a compression scheme to save memory. This compression scheme can
be lossy. For example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The type <code>float32</code> is stored in memory in IEEE single-precision
 floating-point format, and therefore occupies four bytes. This is a lossy
 representation compared to that used for arithmetic on floats, which is the
 IEEE double-precision floating-point format.</li>

 <li>The type <code>byte</code> holds only the bottom 8 bits of an integer,
 and is therefore lossy compared to the 64-bit representation used for integer
 arithmetic.</li>
</ul>

<p>The compression and decompression steps are called "packing" and
"unpacking" respectively. It is generally expected for all types that if you
unpack a value and then pack it again, you get the same string of bytes you
started with, i.e. the round trip is a no-op. It is packing followed by
unpacking that can be lossy.</p>

<p>The "pack" and "unpack" operations are used during assignments, including
function call and return, and variable declarations. The semantics are as
follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The compiler checks if the type of the R-value has an "unpack" operation,
 and if it does, it works out what type if would produce. It then checks if
 that type has an "unpack" operation, and so on, building a list of types.</li>

 <li>It then does the same for the L-value, but using its "pack" operation.</li>

 <li>If the last types in the two lists are incompatible (if the R-value's
 ultimate type is not a subtype of the L-value's ultimate type) then the
 assignment is forbidden.</li>

 <li>If the assignment is allowed, the compiler then tries to shorten the type
 lists by removing the same number of items from the end of each list. It
 removes as many as possible without making the types incompatible.</li>

 <li>The result is a strategy for performing the assignment. It emits code to
 decompress the R-value as often as necessary, and then to compress it as
 often as necessary, and then to copy it into the L-value.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, structured types including structs and unions define pack and
unpack operations in terms of those of their fields. However, the pack and
unpack operations can be overridden, just like other operators, when defining
new types.</p>
