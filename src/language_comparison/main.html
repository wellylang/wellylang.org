<p>C, Java, Python - Obviously. And similar languages including C#, Perl, Ruby.

OCaml - Gets the right balance between power, performance and high-level semantics. However, makes too many basic mistakes, e.g. syntax, 31-bit ints, file organisation, preprocessor.

Haxe - Good syntax and feature set. Not static enough to be fast.</p>

<li> Not making booleans type distinct from integers.</li>
<li> Not supporting "for ... in …”.</li>
<li>  Not having JSON as a subset.</li>
