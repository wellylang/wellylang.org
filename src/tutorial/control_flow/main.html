<h1>Decisions, decisions</h1>

<p class="lead">So far everything we've typed in was executed exactly once, but there are far more useful behaviours than that. In this section we'll write programs that make decisions and that repeat steps.</p>


<h2><code>if</code> statements</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if 31*31 &lt; 1000 {
....   print("Less\n")
.... } else {
....   print("More\n")
.... }</code>
<samp class="nocode">Less</samp>
</pre>

<p>This statement contains two <code>print</code> statements, but only the
first one is executed, because <code>31*31</code> is <code>961</code> which
is less than <code>1000</code>. If you change it to <code>32*32</code> then the second one will be executed instead.</p>

<p>Let's take this apart. The word <code>if</code> is a keyword; it has a special meaning that's built into the language and can't be changed. The next part is an expression, which we call the <em>condition</em>. We can prove that it's an expression by typing it in on its own:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 31*31 &lt; 1000</code>
<samp class="nocode">true: bool</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that the type is <code>bool</code>; the condition has to be a boolean expression.</p>

<p>Next comes a block of statements, enclosed in <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. In general, there can be zero or more statements here. There's exactly one statememt in our example. It's a separable piece, and we can type it in on its own:

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Less\n")</code>
<samp class="nocode">Less</samp>
</pre>

<p>Note that the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are part of the <code>if</code> statement; you have to omit them when you pull the <code>print</code> statement out. Note also that we indented the <code>print</code> statement when it was inside the <code>if</code> statement; you don't have to do this, but it's helpful for people reading the code. Statements in Welly are sometimes nested quite deeply, and without the indentation it can be difficult to tell what's inside what.</p>

<p>The word <code>else</code> is another keyword. After that comes a second block of statements. You can omit everything from <code>else</code> onwards; if you do, it means the same thing as leaving the second block empty.</p>

<p>The <code>if</code> statement decides to execute the first block of statements because the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>. The second block is skipped. If the condition were <code>false</code> it would be the other way around.</p>


<h3>Multi-line statements</h3>

<p>You probably noticed that the <code>if</code> example runs onto five lines.
You can actually write it all on one line if you prefer:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if 31*31 &lt; 1000 { print("Less\n") } else { print("More\n") }</code>
<samp class="nocode">Less</samp>
</pre>

<p>If you do use the five-line version, nothing happens until you press "Enter" for the fifth time. Before that, Welly just prints <code>....</code> instead of the usual <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> to let you know that it's waiting for more input.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake while typing in a long statement, make sure you get the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt back before trying again. If you don't, Welly will probably think you're just continuing on from where you got to. A good trick for telling Welly not to wait for more input is to type lots of close bracket characters; that usually gives a harmless error:<p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if 31*31 &lt; 1000 {
....
....
.... )))))))))))))</code>
<samp class="nocode">ASTError: Unmatched "{"
at line 13, col 17
if 31*31 &lt; 1000 {
                ^</samp>
</pre>


<h3>Comparison with other languages</h3>

<p>If you've ever used C-family programming language such as C, C++, C#, Java or Javascript, the <code>if</code> syntax is probably quite familiar. There are three slight differences:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Brackets are not needed around the condition. You can put them in if you want, but why?</li>
 <li>Second, the blocks of statements <em>must</em> be enclosed in <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>, even if there is only one statement inside. Omitting the braces has proved to cause bugs in other languages, so it's forbidden in Welly.</li>
 <li>Third, you mustn't put a newline before the word <code>else</code>. If you do, Welly has no way of knowing whether you plan on typing <code>else</code> next. In this situation it makes a guess that you're going to omit the <code>else</code> clause.</li>
</ul>
