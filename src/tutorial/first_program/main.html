<h1>Let's try some examples</h1>

<p class="lead">You have already <a href="">installed Welly</a> and run it in
a terminal. Let's start programing! You can copy the code snippets and paste them into your terminal to try them out.</p>


<h3>Values</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello World!"</code>
<samp class="nocode">"Hello World!": str</samp>
</pre>

<p>In the above example, when you enter <code>"Hello World!"</code>, Welly
understands it as a <em>value</em>, and prints it out. Welly also prints its
type, which in this case is <code>str</code> (a string).</p>

<p><code>"Hello, world!"</code> is a <em>string literal</em>. Welly recognises
string literals by the presence of double quotes. The word "literal" in this
context means that the code literally represents a Welly value. Here are some
other kinds of literal:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3</code>
<samp class="nocode">3: int</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3.14159</code>
<samp class="nocode">3.14159: float</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; '3'</code>
<samp class="nocode">51: int</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; '\u0003'</code>
<samp class="nocode">3: int</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true</code>
<samp class="nocode">true: bool</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3]</code>
<samp class="nocode">[1, 2, 3]: array const int</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (1, "2", 3.14159)</code>
<samp class="nocode">(1, "2", 3.14159): struct(int, str, float)</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fn() { return 3 }</code>
<samp class="nocode">unprintable: fn(): (int)</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FREE</code>
<samp class="nocode">FREE(): union {FREE()}</samp>
</pre>

<p>The first four are numbers. The first is an integer literal, and the second
is a floating-point literal. The next two, enclosed in single quotes, are
examples of unicode character literals. 51 is the ASCII code for
the digit "3". After them, <code>true</code> is a Boolean value; the only other
Boolean value is <code>false</code>. Next, the one in square brackets is an
array, and the one in round brackets is a struct (sometimes called a tuple).
The difference is that the array type allows any length, whereas the struct
type allows the values inside to have different types. The one beginning
<code>fn</code> is a function literal; Welly can handle it internally, but
does not have a way of displaying it. Finally, the one spelt entirely in
capital letters is an algebraic value, which is useful for representing
certain kinds of data.</p>

<p>You'll see all these again in this tutorial; for now the points are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>There are lots of different types of value.</li>
 <li>When you enter a value, Welly prints it out with its type.</li>
 <li>Sometimes (as in the <code>fn</code> example) the text we type in, and
in this case the text that Welly prints out, is inadequate to fully represent
the value, which is something abstract inside the computer.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Expressions</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 3</code>
<samp class="nocode">5: int</samp>
</pre>

<p>In this example, we typed something that is not a literal. Welly had to do
some work to turn <code>2 + 3</code> into 5. However, the result
is a value, so Welly printed it out with its type. We can use Welly as a
calculator!</p>

<p>A piece of code that computes a value is called an <em>expression</em>. Here are some other kinds of expression:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.0 * 3.14159</code>
<samp class="nocode">6.28318: float</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello" + "world"</code>
<samp class="nocode">"Helloworld": str</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true &amp; false</code>
<samp class="nocode">false: bool</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~ -6</code>
<samp class="nocode">5: int</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3].length</code>
<samp class="nocode">3: int</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (1, "2", 3.14159)[0]</code>
<samp class="nocode">1: int</samp>
</pre>

<p>The first one is a multiplication, which is spelt <code>*</code>. The
second is a concatenation, which is spelt the same as addition; <code>+</code>
means addition for integers and floating-point numbers, but concatenation for
strings and arrays. Notice that we forgot the space; you might like to fix
that. The third example shows the Boolean "and" operation, spelt
<code>&amp;</code>. The fourth shows a bitwise operation: the <code>~</code>
(tilde) inverts all the bits of the binary encoding of -6, which
gives the binary encoding of 5. The fifth shows how to find the
length of an array. The sixth shows a way to extract a value from a struct;
the same syntax works for arrays too.</p>

<p>You'll see plenty of expressions in this tutorial. For now, the points
are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>There are lots of ways of combining values to make other values.</li>
 <li>Welly will reduce an expression to a value before printing it out.</li>
 <li>Sometimes (as in the <code>+</code> example) the same syntax means
 different things depending on the types of the values involved.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Variables</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; var three = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three = three + 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three</code>
<samp class="nocode">6: int</samp>
</pre>

<p>In the example we have created a storage location. The line beginning with
the <code>var</code> keyword declares a new variable, and names it, in this
case poorly. <code>three</code> is the name we chose, and <code>3</code> is
the initial value of the variable.</p>

<p>The next line has similar syntax, but there is no <code>var</code> keyword,
so it does not create a new variable; it modifies one that already exists. We
modified the variable named <code>three</code>, setting its value to that of
the expression <code>three + 3</code>.</p>

<p>On the third line, we just wrote the name of the variable:
<code>three</code>. A variable name is an expression, so Welly prints out its
value: 6. This shows that the previous line, despite not printing
anything, did something internally.</p>


<h3>Constants</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; const x = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x + 3</code>
<samp class="nocode">ConstnessVMError: can only assign to "var" locations</samp>
</pre>

<p>The <code>const</code> keyword is similar to the <code>var</code> keyword.
It also declares a new variable, names it, and gives it an initial value. The
difference is that it tells Welly not to allow the value to be changed.
Attempting to change it, as on the second line, is an error.</p>

<p>In other respects, <code>x</code> behaves just like any other variable:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; x + x</code>
<samp class="nocode">6: int</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; x</code>
<samp class="nocode">3: int</samp>

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; var y = x - x
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; y</code>
<samp class="nocode">0: int</samp>
</pre>

<p>You can perform any operation on a constant that does not affect the value
of the constant. In the above example, the addition operation is performed on
<code>x</code> and the result is printed, but the original value stays
unchanged.</p>


<h3>Choosing between <code>const</code> and <code>var</code></h3>

<p>If you use <code>const</code>, then the value you define can be used by all
parts of your program without any risk that they interfere with each other. It
is as if they each have a private copy of the variable. Your program may also
go faster, because the compiler can generate better code in some cases.</p>

<p>If you use <code>var</code>, then you will be able to change the value of
the variable. Sometimes this is the simplest way to express your
intention.</p>

<a href="reference/variables.html">here</a>.</p>


<h3>Statements</h3>

Let's look at this part again:

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; var three = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three = three + 3</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that Welly does not print anything out after these two lines, because
they are <em>statements</em> as opposed to expressions. The first is an
example of a <em>variable declaration</em>, and the second is an example of an
<em>assignment</em>.</p>

<p>Here's another kind of a statement: a <em>procedure call</em>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello, world!\n")</code>
<samp class="nocode">Hello, world!</samp>
</pre>

<p>This does print something, but because we asked it to, not because it is an
expression. The <code>print</code> procedure takes a value of type
<code>str</code> and prints out its contents. Compare this to the very first
example at the top of the page, and notice some differences:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Note that the <code>print</code> procedure prints out the actual
 characters in the string; it does not print out the double quotes, as Welly
 would if it were displaying the value, nor does it print a type.</li>

 <li>Note also the special syntax <code>\n</code> inside the string literal.
 This is a way of writing a newline character; it is an example of an
 <em>escape sequence</em>. It looks like Welly didn't print it out, but it
 did. Try removing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will see several other kinds of statement in this tutorial.</p>
