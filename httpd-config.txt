If you're using Apache2, you might want to include the following in its
configuration file. Other web servers will be similar but different.

RewriteEngine On

# We have to do HTTP -> HTTPS on the same host for HSTS to work properly.
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} "!=on"
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 [R,QSA,L]
# The "[...,L]" flags mean we're now on HTTPS.

RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} "!=www.wellylang.org"
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.wellylang.org$1 [R,QSA,L]
# We're now at "https://www.wellylang.org".

RewriteRule ^/?$ /introduction.html [R,QSA,L]

# Security headers, see https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze.html?host=wellylang.org&third-party=false
